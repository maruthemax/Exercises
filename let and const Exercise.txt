<let and const Exercise>

## **Quiz**

- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?

With var, you can both reassign and redeclare a variable. However, using the let keyword, you can only reassign but not redeclare. Additionally, let creates block scope.
Variables declared with var are hoisted, meaning you can access them before they are defined in the code.


- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?

Similar to the previous case, you can reassign and redeclare with var. However, when it comes to const, you cannot redeclare or reassign. Like let, const also creates block scope.
Remember that variables declared with var are hoisted, allowing you to access their names (though with an undefined value) before they are used.


- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?

While you can reassign variables declared with let, you cannot redeclare or reassign those declared with const.


- What is hoisting?

Function declarations are also hoisted. You can invoke them “before” they are defined in your codebase.
